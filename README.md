# Fractals

These program written during course work of MAI-215 Named Fractal Theory.
Most of these programs are completed. Some of them contain error.
I tried using C,C++,Java,Python to build fractals image.

Note:-

While executing c and c++ program use lgraph in last during compliation.
Ex. - gcc example.cpp -lgraph
